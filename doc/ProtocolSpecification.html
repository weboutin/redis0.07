                    <h1><a name="Protocol Specification">Protocol Specification</a></h1>The Redis protocol is a compromise between being easy to parse by a computer
and being easy to parse by an human. Before reading this section you are
strongly encouraged to read the &quot;REDIS TUTORIAL&quot; section of this README in order
to get a first feeling of the protocol playing with it by TELNET.<h2><a name="Networking layer">Networking layer</a></h2>A client connects to a Redis server creating a TCP connection to the port 6973.
Every redis command or data transmitted by the client and the server is
terminated by &quot;\r\n&quot; (CRLF).<h2><a name="Simple INLINE commands">Simple INLINE commands</a></h2>The simplest commands are the inline commands. This is an example of a
server/client chat (the server chat starts with S:, the client chat with C:)<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python" name="code">
C: PING
S: +PONG
</pre>An inline command is a CRLF-terminated string sent to the client. The server
usually replies to inline commands with a single line that can be a number
or a return code.<br/><br/>When the server replies with a status code (that is a one line reply just indicating if the operation succeeded or not), if the first character of the
reply is a &quot;+&quot; then the command succeeded, if it is a &quot;-&quot; then the following
part of the string is an error.<br/><br/>The following is another example of an INLINE command returning an integer:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python" name="code">
C: EXISTS somekey
S: 0
</pre>Since 'somekey' does not exist the server returned '0'.<br/><br/>Note that the EXISTS command takes one argument. Arguments are separated
simply by spaces.<h2><a name="Bulk commands">Bulk commands</a></h2>A bulk command is exactly like an inline command, but the last argument
of the command must be a stream of bytes in order to send data to the server.
the &quot;SET&quot; command is a bulk command, see the following example:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python" name="code">
C: SET mykey 6
C: foobar
S: +OK
</pre>The last argument of the commnad is '6'. This specify the number of DATA
bytes that will follow (note that even this bytes are terminated by two
additional bytes of CRLF).<br/><br/>All the bulk commands are in this exact form: instead of the last argument
the number of bytes that will follow is specified, followed by the bytes,
and CRLF. In order to be more clear for the programmer this is the string
sent by the client in the above sample:<br/><br/><blockquote>&quot;SET mykey 6\r\nfoobar\r\n&quot;</blockquote>
<h2><a name="Bulk replies">Bulk replies</a></h2>The server may reply to an inline or bulk command with a bulk reply. See
the following example:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python" name="code">
C: GET mykey
S: 6
S: foobar
</pre>A bulk reply is very similar to the last argument of a bulk command. The
server sends as the first line the number of bytes of the actual reply
followed by CRLF, then the bytes are sent followed by additional two bytes
for the final CRLF. The exact sequence sent by the server is:<br/><br/><blockquote>&quot;6\r\nfoobar\r\n&quot;</blockquote>
If the requested value does not exist the bulk reply will use the special
value 'nil' instead to send the line containing the number of bytes to read.
This is an example:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python" name="code">
C: GET nonexistingkey
S: nil
</pre>The client library API should not return an empty string, but a nil object.
For example a Ruby library should return 'nil' while a C library should return
NULL.<h2><a name="Bulk reply error reporting">Bulk reply error reporting</a></h2>Bulk replies can signal errors, for example trying to use GET against a list
value is not permitted. Bulk replies use a negative bytes count in order to
signal an error. An error string of ABS(bytes_count) bytes will follow. See
the following example:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python python" name="code">
S: GET alistkey
S: -38
S: -ERR Requested element is not a string
</pre>-38 means: sorry your operation resulted in an error, but a 38 bytes string
that explains this error will follow. Client APIs should abort on this kind
of errors, for example a PHP client should call the die() function.<br/><br/>The following commands reply with a bulk reply: GET, KEYS, LINDEX, LPOP, RPOP<h2><a name="Multi-Bulk replies">Multi-Bulk replies</a></h2>Commands similar to LRANGE needs to return multiple values (every element
of the list is a value, and LRANGE needs to return more than a single element). This is accomplished using multiple bulk writes,
prefixed by an initial line indicating how many bulk writes will follow.
Example:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python python python" name="code">
C: LRANGE mylist 0 3
S: 4
S: 3
S: foo
S: 3
S: bar
S: 5
S: Hello
S: 5
S: World
</pre>The first line the server sent is &quot;4\r\n&quot; in order to specify that four bulk
write will follow. Then every bulk write is transmitted.<br/><br/>If the specified key does not exist instead of the number of elements in the
list, the special value 'nil' is sent. Example:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python python python python" name="code">
C: LRANGE nokey 0 1
S: nil
</pre>A client library API SHOULD return a nil object and not an empty list when this
happens. This makes possible to distinguish between empty list and non existing ones.<h2><a name="Nil elements in Multi-Bulk replies">Nil elements in Multi-Bulk replies</a></h2>Single elements of a multi bulk reply may have -1 length, in order to signal that this elements are missing and not empty strings. This can happen with the SORT command when used with the GET <i>pattern</i> option when the specified key is missing. Example of a multi bulk reply containing an empty element:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python python python python python" name="code">
S: 3
S: 3
S: foo
S: -1
S: 3
S: bar
</pre>The second element is nul. The client library should return something like this:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python python python python python python" name="code">
[&quot;foo&quot;,nil,&quot;bar&quot;]
</pre><h2><a name="Multi-Bulk replies errors">Multi-Bulk replies errors</a></h2>Like bulk reply errors Multi-bulk reply errors are reported using a negative
count. Example:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python python python python python python python" name="code">
C: LRANGE stringkey 0 1
S: -38
S: -ERR Requested element is not a string
</pre>The following commands reply with a multi-bulk reply: LRANGE, LINTER<br/><br/>Check the Bulk replies errors section for more information.<h2><a name="Status code reply">Status code reply</a></h2>As already seen a status code reply is in the form of a single line string
terminated by &quot;\r\n&quot;. For example:<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python python python python python python python python" name="code">
+OK
</pre>and<br/><br/><pre class="codeblock python python python python python python python python python python python python python" name="code">
-ERR no suck key
</pre>are two examples of status code replies. The first character of a status code reply is always &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;.<br/><br/>The following commands reply with a status code reply:
PING, SET, SELECT, SAVE, BGSAVE, SHUTDOWN, RENAME, LPUSH, RPUSH, LSET, LTRIM<h2><a name="Integer reply">Integer reply</a></h2>This type of reply is just a CRLF terminated string representing an integer. For example &quot;0\r\n&quot;, or &quot;1000\r\n&quot; are integer replies.<br/><br/>With commands like INCR or LASTSAVE using the integer reply to actually return a value there is no special meaning for the returned integer. It is just an incremental number for INCR, a UNIX time for LASTSAVE and so on.<br/><br/>Some commands like EXISTS will return 1 for true and 0 for false.<br/><br/>Other commands like SADD, SREM and SETNX will return 1 if the operation was actually done, 0 otherwise, and <b>a negative value</b> if the operation is invalid (for example SADD against a non-set value), accordingly to this table:
<pre class="codeblock python python python python python python python python python python python python python python" name="code">
-1 no such key
-2 operation against the a key holding a value of the wrong type
-3 source and destiantion objects/dbs are the same
-4 argument out of range
</pre>
In all this cases it is mandatory that the client raises an error instead to pass the negative value to the caller. Please check the commands documentation for the exact behaviour.<br/><br/>The following commands will reply with an integer reply: SETNX, DEL, EXISTS, INCR, INCRBY, DECR, DECRBY, DBSIZE, LASTSAVE, RENAMENX, MOVE, LLEN, SADD, SREM, SISMEMBER, SCARD<br/><br/>The commands that will never return a negative integer (commands that can't fail) are: INCR, DECR, INCRBY, DECRBY, LASTSAVE, EXISTS, SETNX, DEL, DBSIZE.<h2><a name="Single line reply">Single line reply</a></h2>This replies are just single line strings terminated by CRLF. Only two commands reply in this way currently, RANDOMKEY and TYPE.<h2><a name="Multiple commands and pipelining">Multiple commands and pipelining</a></h2>A client can use the same connection in order to issue multiple commands.
Pipelining is supported so multiple commands can be sent with a single
write operation by the client, it is not needed to read the server reply
in order to issue the next command. All the replies can be read at the end.<br/><br/>Usually Redis server and client will have a very fast link so this is not
very important to support this feature in a client implementation, still
if an application needs to issue a very large number of commands in short
time to use pipelining can be much faster.<br/><br/>
